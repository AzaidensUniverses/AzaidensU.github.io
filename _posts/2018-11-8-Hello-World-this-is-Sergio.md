title: Hello World!
---

My name is <strong><em>Sergio Lopez</em></strong>, attending <em>Franklin D. Roosevelt in H-tech with El centro</em>.I am 16, and my birthday is in April,so that means I'm a aries.What I wanted to be as I grew up changed.First I wanted to be a <del>doctor </del>because I wanted to fix my sisters eyes because she is blind.Then I used to play <del>soccer</del> and <del>baseball</del> it was fun at the time, I even thought of being a soccer player but it got boring because I'm not really into sports.After my elementary and 5th grade year I started to like music, I started playing flute in 7th, five years and counting.That's what slowly got me into the movie/art branch.Now I wanna be an animator or anything to do with the movie business.

<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Reason why I'm Going to <em>Franklin D. Roosevelt</em>:</strong></span></h3>
The reason why I joined<em> Roosevelt H-tech</em> is one too many.I wanna make my mother proud and show the rest of the world that it is possible,that to never give up,and to prove that I'm not like my father.Also its great to see that I don't only graduate with my diploma but as well as my associates degree.Another reason I joined is because we would be the first generation at <em>Roosevelt High</em> school to be in the program.My first year was amazing and I made lots of friends, as well as my second year.I also love the after school activities and love supporting my school.

Goals:
<ol>
	<li>Get a job that I love.</li>
	<li>Earn lots of money.</li>
	<li>Have a great life.</li>
</ol>
